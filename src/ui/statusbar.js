/**
 * SHOOT! — The travel band.
 *
 * Where am I, how many lives do I have, how hungry am I, how much gold. One
 * strip, in the same place, on every screen inside a run.
 *
 * It used to be two: a status bar and, on the road, a second full-width panel
 * underneath it holding the hunger meter and a row of weather chips. Together
 * they took a fifth of the screen before the game had drawn anything. The
 * hunger gauge now lives here — it is a survival stat like lives and gold, and
 * it belongs with them — and the weather chips are gone, because the sky
 * already shows the weather.
 *
 * FOUR GROUPS, NOT NINE THINGS IN A ROW
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The band used to be a flat list of children with hairline rules dropped
 * between some of them and an invisible spacer holding the right-hand end
 * apart. At a middling width that list wrapped wherever it happened to run out
 * of room, the rules ended up leading nothing, and the hunger meter — the only
 * elastic item — was thrown onto a line of its own where it drew a bar the
 * width of the screen.
 *
 * It is four groups now — where you are, how you are doing, what you have, and
 * what you can press — and each one wraps as a unit. The band measures itself
 * rather than the window (see the container queries in styles/game.css), so the
 * same strip laid over a phone and inside a 420px shop column collapses the
 * same way and at the same point.
 *
 * It subscribes to the event bus itself, so screens just mount it and forget.
