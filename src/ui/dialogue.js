/**
 * SHOOT! — Speech.
 *
 * A character saying something, out loud, with their face next to it. Built as
 * a general system rather than as part of the Stranger's cut-scene, because the
 * first thing it is used for is not the last: any fighter on either side of the
 * road can be given lines, and the box does not know or care which.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One strip along the bottom of the screen: a framed portrait, a name plate,
 * and the line typing itself out a character at a time. It sits over whatever
 * the canvas is drawing, so a scene keeps running behind it — the speaker is
 * still breathing while they talk, which is most of what makes a line land.
 *
 *   const speech = createSpeech();
 *   await speech.say({ name: 'The Stranger', portrait, side: 'enemy',
 *                      text: 'You are a long way from the flats.' });
 *   speech.dispose();
 *
 * `say` resolves when the line is finished with — typed out, then held for as
 * long as it takes to read, or immediately on a tap. Tapping *while* it types
 * finishes the typing instead of skipping the line, which is the one
 * interaction every game with a text box has agreed on for thirty years: the
 * first press catches up, the second moves on.
 *
 * WHY IT TYPES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A line that appears all at once is read at whatever speed the player happens
 * to read at, which is usually faster than any pacing the scene wanted. Typing
 * hands the pacing back: it puts a beat after a comma, a longer one after a
 * full stop, and it gives an em dash the pause an actor would give it. The
 * characters land on a soft tick so a long speech has a voice rather than
 * being silent film.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A MODAL
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no backdrop and nothing is trapped behind it. A speech box that
 * blocks the frame turns a cut-scene into a dialog box, and the whole point of
 * this one is that the fight it interrupts is still visible underneath.
