/**
 * SHOOT! — "THE ROAD IS NOT FINISHED WITH YOU".
 *
 * The second cut-scene in the game, and the only one that plays after a fight
 * rather than before it. The Stranger has gone down, the galaxy is still
 * burning behind the screen, and before the victory card goes up the frame cuts
 * to black and tells the player what beating the game has just opened.
 *
 * IT IS THE BOSS ENTRANCE, PLAYED BACKWARDS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `src/duel/boss-intro.js` is a director pointed at a live duel: it cuts to
 * black, letterboxes, holds on a face, and ends by slamming a name card up and
 * pulling out into the fight. This is the same grammar with nothing to point a
 * camera at — the fight is over — so it borrows the two beats that carry the
 * genre on their own and builds the rest out of type:
 *
 *   1. THE CUT. Black, instantly, and the bars close over it. Not a fade. The
 *      loudest thing a frame can do and it costs one fill.
 *   2. THE LINES. Three of them, one at a time, each held long enough to be
 *      read twice. They are written as the road talking about itself rather
 *      than as a menu explaining a feature — nobody has ever been moved by
 *      "difficulty setting unlocked".
 *   3. THE SLAM. The card lands: HARD, and under it what it is. Speed lines
 *      converge on it, the frame kicks, the bell tolls, and the embers that
 *      have been building the whole time go up all at once.
 *   4. THE PROMISE. The four lines of what actually changes, and the one line
 *      about what is waiting at the end of it, which is the reason to walk it.
 *
 * EVERY PIXEL OF IT IS THE SAME PIXEL AS EVERYTHING ELSE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The embers are the outfit's embers: `createEmberAura` from
 * src/art/ember-aura.js, the emitter that will be burning on the shoulders of
 * the thing this scene is announcing. That is deliberate — the player meets the
 * effect here, ten minutes before they can wear it, and the recognition is the
 * whole point of putting the same emitter in both places rather than drawing
 * two fires that look similar.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing. Exactly like the totem (src/ui/totem.js), it is a black rectangle
 * nailed over whatever was underneath and a promise that resolves when it is
 * over. The unlock is already written by the time this is called — see
 * `finishGame` in src/game/run.js — so a player who closes the tab halfway
 * through still has the road.
