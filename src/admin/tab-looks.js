/**
 * SHOOT! — Admin Panel · Looks.
 *
 * Every garment in the game, locked or not, worn on the spot in the middle of a
 * run — which is the one thing the wardrobe screen will never do, for a good
 * reason: a hat is a reward, and a reward you can help yourself to is not one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It sets a session override (`setOutfitOverride` in src/game/wardrobe.js) and
 * nothing else. The ledger is not touched, the profile is not written, and the
 * moment the run is left or reloaded the player is back in whatever they have
 * actually earned. So a tester can walk the Basin in the Starcrown to see how
 * the light catches it, and nobody has been given anything.
 *
 * There are thirty garments and they are drawn ON the rig at composition time,
 * which is the whole reason this tab exists as pictures rather than as four
 * dropdowns: the bug is always "the trousers do not find the legs in the
 * gallop", and you cannot see that in a list of names.
