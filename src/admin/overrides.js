/**
 * SHOOT! — Admin overrides.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE THE GAME IS ALLOWED TO BE LIED TO
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything the Admin Panel can bend lives in this single mutable object, and
 * every system that can be bent reads it in exactly one line. That shape is
 * deliberate and it is the only reason a debug tool this wide is safe to have
 * in the tree:
 *
 *   - the panel never reaches into a system. It writes a number in here and the
 *     system picks it up on its next tick, so there is no second code path
 *     through the walk, the road, the shop or the duel — there is the real one,
 *     reading one extra multiplier.
 *   - a hook is always written so that the untouched value is the identity: a
 *     multiplier is 1, a replacement is `null`, a flag is `false`. Reset this
 *     object and the game is the game again, with nothing left behind.
 *   - it holds NO imports. Anything in `game/`, `explore/`, `shops/` or `duel/`
 *     can read it without risking an import cycle, which is what lets the hooks
 *     be one line each instead of an event plumbing exercise.
 *
 * IT IS THIS RUN ONLY, AND IT IS NEVER WRITTEN DOWN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing in here is serialised into a save slot. `resetOverrides()` is called
 * when a run is started or loaded (see src/game/run.js), so a slot that was
 * played with the volcano chance at 100% comes back tomorrow as an ordinary
 * run. A tester who wants the change again makes it again — that is the whole
 * contract, and it is what keeps a bent run from quietly becoming a bent save.
 *
 * The one thing that DOES persist is the door itself (which slots have been
 * unlocked, and how many attempts each one has left) — see src/admin/access.js.
