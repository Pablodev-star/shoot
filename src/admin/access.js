/**
 * SHOOT! — The Admin Panel's door.
 *
 * Two locks, in this order:
 *
 *   1. THE SIGIL. Three big letters drawn over the road while you are walking —
 *      see src/admin/sigil.js for what counts as one and why it cannot be
 *      stumbled into. Nothing on the screen hints that it exists.
 *   2. THE PASSPHRASE. The sigil only opens a box to type it into. Get it right
 *      and the slot is an admin slot from then on; get it wrong three times and
 *      that slot never opens again.
 *
 * …AND, ONCE THOSE TWO HAVE BEEN GOT PAST, A BUTTON
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A lock is worth what it is worth the first time. An unlocked slot is unlocked
 * for good, so from then on it also gets a one-tap button on the road, shown by
 * default and hideable from inside the panel — see `shortcutShown` below. It is
 * a shortcut past the ceremony, never past the lock: it refuses outright for a
 * slot that has not already been through both of the above.
 *
 * THREE ATTEMPTS, PER SLOT, FOREVER
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The count is kept against the SLOT NUMBER and not against the run in it, and
 * it is written through the ordinary storage driver, so it outlives everything
 * a run can do to itself:
 *
 *   - dying erases the save and does not give the attempts back
 *   - erasing the slot by hand from the picker does not either
 *   - starting a new run in slot 2 inherits whatever slot 2 has left
 *
 * That is what "permanent" means here, and it is the point of a three-guess
 * lock: a tester is told the phrase and types it, and anybody else spends the
 * three guesses they will ever have on a word they have never seen. There is
 * deliberately no cooldown, no hint, and no way back — a lockout that can be
 * waited out is a lockout that can be brute-forced by somebody patient.
 *
 * THE PHRASE IS NOT IN THIS FILE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is stored is a fingerprint of it. That is not cryptography and it is not
 * pretending to be — anything shipped to a browser can be read — it is the same
 * courtesy as not printing the answer at the bottom of the page: somebody
 * reading the source to find out how the door works does not have the phrase
 * handed to them on the way past. Case and surrounding spaces are ignored
 * before hashing, because burning one of three permanent attempts on a capital
 * letter would be a cruel joke rather than a security measure.

 * and type a word every time they want to look at the Basin's boss is not
 * security, it is a toll — the slot is already an admin slot, permanently, and
 * anybody who can reach that state can reach it again in twenty seconds.
 *
 * So an unlocked slot gets a button on the road that opens the panel directly.
 * It shows up by itself the moment the passphrase is accepted, because that is
 * the moment it becomes useful, and it can be put away from inside the panel
 * for the one job it gets in the way of: taking a screenshot of the road, or
 * handing the game to somebody who should not be looking at the workbench. The
 * sigil still works with the button hidden, which is what makes hiding it safe.
 *
 * The preference is written against the SLOT, next to the unlock itself, so it
 * survives a reload the way the unlock does — and it is mirrored in memory so
 * that a screen can ask for it while it is building its own DOM.
