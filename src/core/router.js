 * SHOOT! — Screen router.

 *   - mounting / unmounting screens into #screen-root
 *   - the animated transition between them (a saloon-door style wipe)
 *   - a back stack, so every screen gets a working "Back" without wiring
 *
 * A screen is `{ id, mount(root, params) -> void, unmount?() -> void }`.

   * This used to be `if (transitioning) return;` — a guard against two screens
   * mounting on top of each other, which is a real thing to guard against and
   * the wrong way to do it. A `go` is not always a button press: the walk
   * engine fires ENCOUNTER_REACHED from inside its own frame, and the run
   * controller answers that with a `go`. The doors are open for 640 ms around
   * every mount, and the walk is running for the second half of that — so an
   * encounter that came up inside the out-swing was silently thrown away.
   *
   * The engine had already paused itself and marked the event resolved by
   * then, so nothing was ever going to fire it again: the player stood on an
   * empty road, in the walk's idle pose, with no way forward. THAT is the
   * "loading a slot freezes the character" bug — a saved position lands
   * wherever it lands, and any save made within about twenty pixels of the
   * next encounter reloaded straight into the dead window.
   *
   * So the request is remembered instead. The transition in flight finishes
   * its own mount, then runs whatever came in behind it; the last one asked
   * for wins, because a screen that has been superseded before it was ever
   * shown is not worth showing.
