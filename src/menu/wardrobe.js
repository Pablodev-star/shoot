/**
 * SHOOT! — The wardrobe screen.
 *
 * Reached by tapping the avatar on the profile — the pencil in the corner of
 * the plate is the invitation. Clothes on the left, the man wearing them on the
 * right, and nothing is committed until Save.
 *
 * THE MANNEQUIN IS THE POINT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every other way of showing an outfit is a list of four nouns. So the right
 * half of the screen is the gunslinger himself, breathing on the spot in the
 * idle loop the game uses everywhere else, wearing what is currently selected —
 * not what is currently SAVED. Pick a hat and it is on his head before your
 * finger is off the card, which is the whole reason to draw him at all.
 *
 * NOTHING IS COMMITTED UNTIL SAVE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The preview is composed off to one side (`previewSprites`) and never touches
 * the rig's own cache, so the man at the end of the road behind this screen
 * keeps wearing the saved outfit while you try things on in front of him. Save
 * writes the profile, dresses the rig, and the backdrop changes on the next
 * frame — along with the profile portrait, the road, the saddle and the duel.
 *
 * LOCKED IS DRAWN, NOT HIDDEN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Same rule as the achievements screen it borrows from: every garment in the
 * game is on this screen from the first minute, a locked one greyed to a flat
 * mannequin with the line it is waiting for printed underneath. You cannot go
 * and earn something you have never been shown — and now that half the drawer
 * is bought rather than earned, you cannot go and BUY something you have never
 * been shown either, so a locked card says which of the two it is waiting for.
 *
 * THE LAST DRAWER SHOWS A HORSE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Tack is worn by the animal, so the mannequin is swapped for the animal while
 * that drawer is open: same plate, same idle loop, the rider up in whatever
 * else is being tried on. A harness cannot be judged on a man, and a bridle
 * drawn on nothing is four brown pixels.
