/**
 * SHOOT! — Achievements screen.
 *
 * The ledger, read back. It took the Credits' place on the main menu (the
 * credits screen itself is untouched and still registered — it simply has no
 * door on it for now), because a menu entry is a promise about what the player
 * will find behind it, and a list of things still to do is worth more of the
 * front page than a history of the project.
 *
 * THE PERCENTAGE IS THE HEADLINE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One number, at the top, big: how much of the game you have actually seen.
 * Everything else on the screen is that number taken apart — the count under
 * it, the bar behind it, and six sections that each say how much of themselves
 * is done. A player who opens this screen wants to know what is left, so what
 * is left is what the screen leads with.
 *
 * LOCKED IS NOT HIDDEN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every card is legible whether or not it has been earned: name, what it asks
 * for, and its reward slot. There are no secret achievements, because a secret
 * achievement is one the player cannot decide to go and get, and this list is
 * meant to be a set of things to go and do. Locked ones are simply drained of
 * colour, with a padlock where the medal goes.
 *
 * THE REWARD ROW IS FULL NOW
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It used to read "Clothing — coming soon" on every card in the game. The
 * wardrobe exists (src/game/wardrobe.js), so twenty-six of these lines now show
 * the garment they hand over — a picture of the thing, its slot and its name —
 * and the row is a picture of what is behind the lock rather than a promise.
 *
 * The picture is a CROP of a gunslinger wearing it, not an icon drawn twice:
 * the same art the wardrobe screen dresses the mannequin in, sliced to the rows
 * that garment lives on. There is no second version of a hat to keep in step.
 *
 * The lines that pay nothing say so plainly. An achievement whose reward is the
 * fact you did it is not a broken one, and "coming soon" on sixty of them was
 * worse than an honest blank.
