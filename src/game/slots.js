/**
 * SHOOT! — Save slot picker.
 *
 * Story Mode always comes through here. Each card answers the only three
 * questions that matter at a glance: where am I, how am I doing, and what
 * happens if I press this.
 *
 * The card leads with the world's name rather than the slot number, because
 * "Dust Flats" is what a player remembers about a run and "Slot 2" is what the
 * save system calls it.
 *
 * AND IT IS WHERE THE ROAD IS CHOSEN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A slot is created with a difficulty and keeps it for as long as it exists
 * (see the note at the bottom of src/game/difficulty.js), so the empty card is
 * the one and only place that choice is ever offered. It is offered INSIDE the
 * card rather than as a dialog on top of it: an empty slot has nothing else in
 * it, and a picker that opens a modal to ask one question is a picker that
 * makes the answer feel like a settings change instead of the first decision of
 * the run.
 *
 * The choice only appears once the hard road is unlocked. Before that the card
 * is exactly what it always was — one button that says "New run" — because a
 * dropdown with one option in it is a dropdown that exists to advertise the
 * option that is missing, and the game already has a place for telling you what
 * you have not done yet.
