/**
 * SHOOT! — The wardrobe.
 *
 * What every garment is CALLED, what it is worth saying about it, and which
 * line of the ledger has to be crossed off before it can be worn. The art
 * itself is in `src/art/sprites-wardrobe.js`; this file is the catalogue, the
 * lock, and the drawer the outfit is kept in — exactly the split the forge
 * ladder uses (`src/game/gun-tiers.js` is data, the press is in the art).
 *
 * WHERE THE LOCK COMES FROM
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two places, and a garment belongs to exactly one of them.
 *
 * EARNED. A garment does not name its achievement — the achievement names its
 * reward (`reward: { kind: 'clothing', slot, id }` in
 * src/game/achievements.js) and this file reads the list backwards. One
 * direction, one source of truth: retune an achievement, move a reward, drop a
 * line entirely, and the wardrobe follows without anybody remembering it exists.
 *
 * BOUGHT. Everything marked `source: 'shop'` hangs on no achievement at all and
 * is sold over one counter in the game: the clothing shop, which turns up once
 * in a whole run, in a world the seed picks (see src/shops/tailor.js). Those are
 * the pieces at the END of every drawer, and they are the reason the drawer has
 * two halves: what the road gave you, and what you paid for. A bought garment is
 * written onto the PROFILE the moment it is paid for, so it is yours for good —
 * not for the run, which would make a shop that appears once a run a shop that
 * sells you nothing.
 *
 * WHAT AN OUTFIT IS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Five ids on the profile, next to the name — device-side, outside the save
 * slots, through the same storage driver as everything else. It survives a run
 * dying, because a hat earned by beating the boss of the Basin is not something
 * to lose to a bad duel in the Flats.
 *
 * The fifth is the HORSE's, and it is worn by the horse rather than by the man:
 * a harness comes whole (see the note in src/art/sprites-wardrobe.js) and one of
 * them is deliberately nothing at all, for a player who likes the animal bare.
 *
 * The equipped outfit is validated on every read. A profile that arrives from
 * somewhere else claiming a Starcrown, with the ledger saying otherwise, walks
 * out in the hat it started in.

 * be read on the card next to the picture, never restating the picture.
