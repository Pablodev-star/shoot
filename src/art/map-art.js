/**
 * SHOOT! — Trail-map art.
 *
 * The Map item no longer prints a line of text: it opens a drawn map of the
 * stretch of road you are on. This file paints that map. The panel that lets
 * you drag and zoom around it is `src/ui/map-panel.js`; everything here is
 * pigment.
 *
 * IT IS THE WORLD SEEN FROM ABOVE, NOT A PIECE OF PARCHMENT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious way to draw a treasure map is a sheet of brown paper with a
 * squiggle on it. That is a picture of a *prop*, and it would have told the
 * player nothing about where they actually are. So the sheet is the ground
 * itself: the desert is sand, ripples and saguaro; the prairie is grass,
 * ponds and trees. Walk from world 1 into world 2 and the map changes biome
 * with the road, which is the whole point of it.
 *
 * The map furniture — the dashed road, the red X over the boss, the compass
 * rose — is the only thing on it borrowed from cartography, and it is drawn in
 * the same palette as everything else.
 *
 * THE GROUND HAS A SHAPE, NOT A COLOUR
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The first version of this map painted a flat fill and dropped seventy soft
 * ellipses on it. From above that reads as a *stain*: there is no high ground,
 * no hollow, nothing for the road to be going around. So the ground is now a
 * height field — four octaves of value noise, built once per map — and every
 * pass reads from it:
 *
 *   COLOUR   the elevation picks a step of the biome's own five-colour ramp,
 *            Bayer-dithered between steps so the ramp reads as one continuous
 *            landscape and still resolves to five flat colours up close.
 *   RELIEF   the slope of the field lightens ground that faces the sun and
 *            darkens ground that turns away from it. One sun, top-left, over
 *            every map in the game.
 *   CONTOURS every few steps of height, a thin line of the biome's deepest
 *            tone — the one piece of real cartography on the sheet, and what
 *            makes a rise read as a rise rather than as a smudge.
 *   PLACEMENT water pools in the hollows, scrub climbs the slopes, and the
 *            props thin out on the high ground.
 *
 * WHERE THE SCENERY COMES FROM
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing here draws a cactus or a tree. The props scattered over the map are
 * the biome's own roadside props, pulled straight out of the bundle the
 * parallax renderer uses (`getEnvironmentSprites`), placed in profile the way a
 * pictorial map has always drawn its forests and its hills. That means a new
 * biome gets a new map for free: write `src/art/biomes/<id>.js`, and its map is
 * its own props on its own ground.
 *
 * Every world has its own landscape now, so every world has its own map: sand,
 * grass, snow, black water, basalt, grave earth, and the shelf out past the
 * last horizon.
 * What differs between them is only the TERRAIN entry below and the props the
 * bundle hands over — no map code is aware of any particular place. The three
 * things that separate one world's sheet from another's are all data: which
 * five colours the ramp is made of, which *detail passes* run over it (arroyos,
 * ice cracks, magma fissures, astral veins are one routine with four colour
 * sets), and whether there is running water on it.

/**
 * How each biome's ground looks from above.
 *
 * `ramp` is the whole landscape: five steps of the biome's own family, light to
 * dark, and every square inch of ground is one of them. It is the same ramp the
 * side-on art uses, so a map of the prairie and a walk through the prairie are
 * the same five greens.
 *
 * `base` is where the flat ground sits on that ramp, `spread` how much of it a
 * map actually uses — how hilly the country is — and `relief` how hard the sun
 * rakes across it. The three together are the difference between a plain and a
 * broken one, and `base` is the one that has to be right first: the ramps run
 * from the brightest colour in the game to nearly black, and a map that centres
 * itself on the middle step is a map of the same country at dusk.
 *
 * `ripples` and `blades` pick which texture pass runs over the top: sand and
 * snow lie in wind-blown arcs, grass and reed stand up in short strokes, and
 * swapping the two is the fastest way to make a biome look like the other one
 * wearing a filter.
 *
 * `veins` is the one routine four worlds share and no two use the same way: a
 * wandering, branching, tapering crack. In the desert it is a dry wash cut into
 * the sand, in the pass an ice fracture, in the basin a fissure with magma
 * still in it, and out past the last horizon a seam of astral light. Same walk,
 * four colour sets, and a `glow` where the crack is lit from inside.
 *
 * `ponds` is how many pools of standing water to try to place, `river` whether
 * there is running water, and `water` says what either is made of. A prairie
 * pond is blue because it is holding the sky; a bayou pool is black because it
 * is holding nothing, and the basin's "ponds" are lava. Same routine, three
 * completely different readings — which is exactly the split that made it worth
 * passing the colours in rather than writing a second painter.
