/**
 * SHOOT! — Inn logic (Block 4).
 *
 * A bed is the cheapest life on the road, and both of them are on the counter
 * at once so the choice is always the same one: patch up, or sleep it off and
 * walk out with nothing left to spend.
 *
 *   Basic Bed    heals innBasicHeal(world, maxLives) — a bit under half of you
 *   Premium Bed  heals everything
 *   Both prices follow the same exponential curve as shop items, and both are
 *   eligible for the same random 50% discount (boosted by shop perks).
 *
 * Inns used to be generated as an inseparable pair with a shop, and this note
 * used to say so. They have been rolled independently since — see the header
 * of src/explore/encounters.js — so a stretch can hold two beds and one store,
 * or a store, three fights and another store with nowhere to sleep in between.
