/**
 * SHOOT! — The clothing shop.
 *
 * The one counter in the game that sells nothing you can use. No lives, no
 * rounds, no hunger, no perk — a garment does exactly one thing, which is to be
 * the clothes the gunslinger is wearing in every screen of every run after this
 * one. That is the whole pitch, and the screen is built to make it, in this
 * order: the thing itself, drawn big; what it is; what it costs.
 *
 * IT IS THE STALL, BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME TRANSACTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Same frame as the general store (`stall-screen`), same three cards, same
 * discount flag hanging off the corner, same "N gold short" when it is out of
 * reach. Everything a player learned at the first counter they ever stopped at
 * is true here. What changes is the ROOM behind it — a clothier's, not a
 * trading post's (see `createInteriorScene('tailor')`) — and the goods on the
 * shelf, which are pictures of clothes instead of pictures of tins.
 *
 * WHAT A PURCHASE ACTUALLY DOES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Writes to the PROFILE and not to the run: a garment bought here is in the
 * wardrobe tomorrow, and it is still there after the run it was bought in dies
 * in the Bayou. That is the only thing on this screen that behaves differently
 * from the general store, and it is the reason the shop exists at all — it
 * turns up once in a whole run (see src/explore/encounters.js) and a shop that
 * rare selling something that perishable would be a cruel joke.
 *
 * A complete outfit is four garments in one purchase and is written the same
 * way, in one call, because a half-written set is the one state the wardrobe
 * must never be left in.
