/**
 * SHOOT! — The boss entrance.
 *
 * The last fight in the game used to start the way the first one does: a wipe,
 * two figures on a road, "Choose your move". Everything the journey had been
 * building towards arrived with less ceremony than a shop.
 *
 * IT IS THE FIGHT, FILMED
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The first version of this drew the boss's portrait on a black card and panned
 * around it. That is a menu with a face in it. What a western actually does —
 * and what this does now — is point a camera at the two men who are already
 * standing on the road: the duel scene is live from the first frame, both
 * fighters are in it, the weather is running, and the sequence is nothing but
 * *shots of it*.
 *
 * So there is no second renderer here and nothing of the scene is duplicated.
 * This file is a director. It moves `scene.lookAt(...)`, sets flags in
 * `scene.fx`, and hands lines to the speech box, and every pixel it produces
 * was going to be drawn anyway.
 *
 * THE SHOT LIST
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. CUT TO BLACK, and letterbox. Not a fade — a cut. The loudest thing a
 *      scene can do, and it costs nothing.
 *   2. THE EYES, OUT OF THE DARK. The camera is already inches from his face
 *      when the black lifts, over two and a half seconds, and his fire comes
 *      up with it.
 *   3. HE TALKS, and every line is a framing: eyes, the whole of him, a low
 *      angle. The player answers and the camera cuts to the player's face,
 *      because a conversation shot from one angle is a monologue.
 *   4. THE HANDS. A beat of silence on the player's holster, with a heartbeat
 *      under it. This is the shot the whole genre is built on.
 *   5. THE SLAM. Crash zoom onto the sockets, speed lines converging, impact
 *      frames, a shockwave, the name card along the top of the frame, and the
 *      camera pulling back out to the fight — which has already started.
 *
 * Every beat is skippable, and the whole thing is data: the lines and their
 * framings live on the boss in src/game/worlds.js. Give any boss an `intro`
 * and it gets an entrance.
