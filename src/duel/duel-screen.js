/**
 * SHOOT! — Duel screen.
 *
 * The presentation of a duel: three big buttons, both fighters' lives and
 * bullets, the round-by-round animation, and the battle overview that closes
 * the fight (the feature the third version was best remembered for).
 *
 * Readability rules:
 *  - Both fighters are drawn the same way: name, lives, and a six-chamber
 *    cylinder. An empty gun is six dark holes — the old screen printed the
 *    words "no bullets" under each fighter on every round of every duel.
 *  - Each button carries its cost as pips, not as a sentence. "+1 bullet · you
 *    are open" under Reload was the rulebook reprinted on every turn; the rules
 *    belong in How to Play, and the button belongs to the player who already
 *    knows them.
 *  - One callout line states the situation, and it sits directly above the
 *    controls so it never covers the duellists.
 *  - The enemy's abilities are shown up front, so nothing is a surprise twice —
 *    as icons, not as words. Poison, dynamite, bullet steal and mind control
 *    are things the player should recognise on sight, and the row of names they
 *    used to be was the only part of the screen asking to be read twice. The
 *    names are still on the tooltip and on `aria-label`.
 *  - What is currently *happening* to a fighter is separate from what they can
 *    do: live effects sit in their own row and count down.
 *
 * All rules live in duel-engine.js. This file never decides an outcome.
